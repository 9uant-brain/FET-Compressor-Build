## Why I made this
After finishing my RAT2 project, I built and even bought a few more pedals. But I still didn’t have a compressor pedal. The reason was simple: compressors tend to be deprioritized because they don’t shape the sound dramatically. They mainly tame loud peaks while slightly boosting quieter parts—or so I thought.

However, when I got hooked on Jimi Hendrix’s music, I realized I needed a compressor. His playing focuses on a sophisticated yet raw electric guitar tone, and compression plays a key role in achieving that.

I could have just bought a cheap Chinese pedal, but I decided to build my own instead. There were several reasons for that choice.

First, I wanted a compressor with attack and release controls to get a truly clean guitar tone—but even China-made pedals with these features tend to be quite expensive.

Second, I wanted a compressor versatile enough for both guitar and bass. For that, a dry/wet mix (also known as parallel compression) was essential. Bass guitars typically have very strong signals, and if a compressor isn’t designed specifically to handle them, it can cause a “pumping” effect. This happens when the compressor clamps down too aggressively on the signal and then releases, creating an audible swell or “pump.” By blending in some dry signal with the compressed tone, this effect can be reduced or avoided.

For these reasons (mostly due to cost-effectiveness), I decide to make a compressor on my own.
